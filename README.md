## Validate Stack Sequences
*Given two sequences pushed and popped with distinct values, return true if and only if this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack. This is from https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-stack-sequences/*

## Next Greater Element I
*You are given two arrays (without duplicates) nums1 and nums2 where nums1’s elements are subset of nums2. Find all the next greater numbers for nums1's elements in the corresponding places of nums2. The Next Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first greater number to its right in nums2. If it does not exist, output -1 for this number. This is from https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/*

## Remove Outermost Parentheses
*A valid parentheses string is either empty (""), "(" + A + ")", or A + B, where A and B are valid parentheses strings, and + represents string concatenation. For example, "", "()", "(())()", and "(()(()))" are all valid parentheses strings. A valid parentheses string S is primitive if it is nonempty, and there does not exist a way to split it into S = A+B, with A and B nonempty valid parentheses strings. Given a valid parentheses string S, consider its primitive decomposition: S = P_1 + P_2 + ... + P_k, where P_i are primitive valid parentheses strings. Return S after removing the outermost parentheses of every primitive string in the primitive decomposition of S. This is from https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-outermost-parentheses/*

## Largest Rectangle in Histogram
*Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram. This is from https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/*

## Daily Temperatures
*Given a list of daily temperatures T, return a list such that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put 0 instead. This is from https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/*

##  Binary Search Tree Iterator
*Implement an iterator over a binary search tree (BST). Your iterator will be initialized with the root node of a BST. Calling next() will return the next smallest number in the BST. This is from https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search-tree-iterator/*

##  Split Linked List in Parts
*Given a (singly) linked list with head node root, write a function to split the linked list into k consecutive linked list "parts".
The length of each part should be as equal as possible: no two parts should have a size differing by more than 1. This may lead to some parts being null.
The parts should be in order of occurrence in the input list, and parts occurring earlier should always have a size greater than or equal parts occurring later. This is from https://leetcode.com/problems/split-linked-list-in-parts/*

## Validate Binary Search Tree
*Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST). This is from https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/*

## Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node
*Given a perfect binary tree, populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL. This is from https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node//*
